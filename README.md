    Eidos is an extensible framework for managing your personal data throughout your lifetime in one place.
    </p>
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Eidos sets a big goal in mind, but it is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of work to be done. You can give it a try, but I do not recommend using it for production purposes. If you're interested in this project, I recommend staying updated on its development. If you have an Early Access key, you'll receive an email notification when Eidos is officially released.

## Features

- Everything runs inside your browser. It's a pure PWA with no web server.
- Offline Support: Access your data without an internet connection. Data is stored locally for blazing-fast performance.
- AI Features: Deeply integrated with LLM for AI-powered capabilities. Translate, summarize, and interact with your data within Eidos. AI works even offline.
- Extensible: Customize Eidos to suit your needs.

  - Prompt: Speed up your workflow with the Prompt extension. No coding required.
  - UDF: Use JavaScript to customize Formula functions.
  - Script: Create powerful data processing logic with TypeScript/JavaScript.
  - App: Build your own app using any preferred framework. (POC)
  - Block: Extend documents with custom blocks.(POC)
  - Field: Extend tables with custom fields.(Soon)

- Developer Friendly:

  - API & SDK
  - Sqlite Standardization: Every table in Eidos is a SQLite table.

## Requirements

Currently, Eidos only supports the latest version of chromium-based browsers, such as Chrome, Edge, Arc, and Brave. It recommends a version greater than 122.

Safari, Firefox, and other browsers are not tested yet.

### Why?

Eidos is built on sqlite-wasm and requires browser support for OPFS[1] to work.

Storing data in a local folder is a good practice to ensure better data security. With Chrome 122 and its later versions, we can get persistent permissions[2] for local folders, so we do not have to select a folder every time we open the web app.

2. https://developer.chrome.com/blog/persistent-permissions-for-the-file-system-access-api

## How to develop

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:mayneyao/eidos.git`
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `pnpm build` (only needed once)
3. Run `sudo pnpm add -D vite -w`
4. Run `pnpm dev`
5. You can now access the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173

### Generate sdk types

```shell
pnpm gen-types
```

## How to deploy your own

## Roadmap

https://github.com/users/mayneyao/projects/5

- [ ] Publish Service: Publish your data to the web.
- [ ] P2p sync based on CRDT: local-first, not local-only. Sync your data across devices.
